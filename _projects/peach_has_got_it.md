# Background

Rising Star was a multi-stage games programming competition for graduates part way through there studies, that I had the honour of participating in. Candidates first face technical questioning focused on C++. Then they are set a coding task by Relentless Software, where a barebones game is presented to candidates, and they were given one week to fix the bugs, and add new features.

The features that I chose to add to the game were:

 - Animated Graphics
 - Sound Effects
 - Font Loading
 - Multiple Levels
 - PNG Level Loader
 
Peach Has Got It! is the result of this week long coding task and features the lovely Princess Peach finding her way back to the castle, being careful to avoid the nasty Goombas! The game was playable at Eurogamer Expo 2012.
