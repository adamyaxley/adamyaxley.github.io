# Background

Ninja cat started out as a simple endless runner game that I made to test the capabilities of the [Pineapple Game Engine](/projects/pineapple) one weekend in 2013. At that time, the Pineapple Game Engine did not have great support for mobile platforms, and I ended up spending 90% of my time implementing Android and iOS platforms.

In Ninja Cat, the platforms are generated completely at random each time you play. The  platforms positions are calculated based on the jumping or falling velocity of the player using the equations for projectile motion, also known as SUVAT.
